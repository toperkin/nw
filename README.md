# NWChem 6.0  on  Windows 8

### primary source : http://timn.ho.ua/ccs/
### see also : http://www.nwchem-sw.org/

Basically I just followed the directions in the primary source to get NWChem working quickly on my Windows 8 laptop.  For ease of use and 
distribution, I've posted all this to github.

To use download the .zip of this folder (lower RHS of this page).  Open the zip and copy the folders nwchem and nwrun to '''C:\'''.  To use 
simply click on nwRun.exe in the nwrun folder.  If you change the location of these folders you will have to edit the prepare.ini file in 
the nwrun folder.

nwRun provides a simple GUI interface for running nwchem programs.

I claim no ownership over the files in nwchem or nwrun.  They are freely available from the sources above.  All I've done is combine them 
into one convinent location for easy installation.


If you have questions, please feel free to contact me.
